# Animated Button Microinteractions

## Overview
This is a lightweight, dependency-free web page showcasing animated button microinteractions:
- Ripple animation on click
- Magnetic hover that subtly follows the pointer
- Glossy shine sweep on hover
All animations are implemented with modern, accessible HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The page respects the system “Reduce Motion” setting and degrades gracefully.

## Setup
- No build tools required.
- Download or clone the repository and open index.html in any modern browser.
- The page uses only system fonts and contains all CSS and JS inline for fast load times.

## Usage
- Hover on the “Hover me” or “Done” buttons to see the magnetic hover and shine effects.
- Click any button to see the ripple animation.
- Try using the keyboard: focus a button and press Enter or Space to trigger the ripple.
- If your system has “Reduce Motion” enabled, motion-heavy effects are minimized.
